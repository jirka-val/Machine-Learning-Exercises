    "# Machine Learning - Exercise 4\n",
    "This exercise focuses on application of clustering techniques on the selected dataset from the Kaggle or UCI repository. Students will apply different clustering algorithms, compare their results, and visualize the clustering structure using scatter plots.\n",

    "* 💡 **Agglomerative clustering** is a **bottom-up approach** to clustering.\n",
    "    * We first divide **each instance into its own cluster** and **merge them into couples** based on a similarity metric.\n",
    "    * Subsequently we compute the **similarity** again and **merge the couples into bigger groups** (clusters).\n",
    "    * These groups are then merged into the bigger ones **till there is only a one big group containing all the instances present at the top**.\n",

    "* 💡 **K-means** is a **partitioning approach** to clustering.\n",
    "    * We **first choose the number of clusters K** and **initialize K centroids** (often at random).\n",
    "    * Repeatedly **assign each point to its nearest centroid** (by a distance like Euclidean).\n",
    "    * Then **recompute each centroid** as the mean of the points assigned to it.\n",
    "    * **Iterate assignment** → update until centroids stop moving (or a max number of steps is reached).\n",
    "    * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html\n",
    "* 💡 **DBSCAN** is a **density-based approach** to clustering.\n",
    "    * We set **ε (eps) for neighborhood radius** and **min_samples for the minimum points** to form dense regions.\n",
    "    * **Points with ≥ min_samples** neighbors **within ε are core points,** neighbors of cores are **border points**, others are **noise/outliers**.\n",
    "    * **Start from a core point and expand** by connecting nearby cores/borders to **grow a cluster**.\n",
    "    * **Repeat** until all points are visited—yielding clusters of arbitrary shapes and identifying outliers naturally.\n",
