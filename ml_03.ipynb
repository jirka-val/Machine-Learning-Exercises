    "* 💡 Agglomerative clustering is a **bottom-up approach** to clustering.\n",
    "    * We first divide **each instance into its own cluster** and **merge them into couples** based on a similarity metric.\n",
    "    * Subsequently we compute the **similarity** again and **merge the couples into bigger groups** (clusters).\n",
    "    * These groups are then merged into the bigger ones **till there is only a one big group containing all the instances present at the top**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **We don't have to know the number of clusters beforehand.**  \n",
    "* 💡 We can perform the whole clustering process and **select the appropriate number of clusters afterward** based on the obtained results. \n",
    "* We usually use the **dendrogram** for the distance threshold estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔎 You may ask how is the similarity among groups computed. \n",
    "* 💡 **Similarity is pretty hard to define.**\n",
    "* There are various ways how we can compute the value called **Linkage**.\n",

    "    - The distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum value of all pairwise distances between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2.\n",
    "    - It tends to produce more compact clusters.\n",
    "    - It is less prone to outliers than Single linkage.\n",

    "    - The distance between two clusters is defined as the minimum value of all pairwise distances between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2.\n",
    "    - It tends to produce long, “loose” clusters.\n",
    "    - Single linkage method is prone to \"chain\" and form clusters of irregular, often thread-like curved shapes.\n",
    "        - The reason for that is obvious. With this method, at any step, **two clusters are merged if their closest edges are close enough**.\n",
    "        - No proximity between other parts of the two clusters is taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Mean or Average linkage**:\n",
    "    - The distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2.\n",
